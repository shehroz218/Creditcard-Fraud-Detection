# Creditcard-Fraud-Detection

In this Notebook I use the classic Machine learning Model using logistic regressions to classify my dataset into fraud and legitimate transactions. Then I used this dataset to predict whether a transaction would be a fraud or a legitimate one.
+ There are two versions of this submission one uses the sklearn library and automatically computers everything. 
+ In the second one I created all of the variabl;es inside a logistic regressions, without the use of any ML library.
